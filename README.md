## Introduction

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishisdesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rishika Garg</a>, a **3rd-year Communication Design student from Nirma University**, approached me to develop her portfolio website, which she had carefully designed herself. She provided a detailed brief outlining the specific **animations and interactions** she wanted to showcase her work creatively. I accepted this challenge and built a **responsive website** that brought her vision to life, incorporating **seamless animations** and optimizing the **user experience across all devices**. The platform includes:

- <ins>**Advanced Content Management System (CMS)**</ins> with a modern drag-and-drop interface, enabling easy addition and update of projects by the client.
- <ins>**Optimized media uploads to Firebase Storage**</ins>, with strict file type and size restrictions for efficient storage management and reduced upload times.
- <ins>**Smooth image rendering through lazy loading**</ins>, implemented via the Blurhash library to enhance user experience.
- <ins>**Unique animations and user experience**</ins>, powered by the FramerMotion library, which contributed to the client's success in securing internships at leading design firms.
- <ins>**Responsive design**</ins>, ensuring a seamless experience across devices, whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile.
- <ins>**Secure login and password reset functionality**</ins>, ensuring client access and management.
- </ins>**Routing using React Router DOM**</ins>, allowing for efficient navigation between pages.

## Running Locally

## Running Locally

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repositories**:
   - For the server: 
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/mr-kingshuk/rishi-portfolio-server.git
     ```
   - For the client: 
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/mr-kingshuk/rishi-portfolio-client.git
     ```

2. **Fill the `.env` file**: 
   - Use the `template.env` file as a reference to configure your environment variables.

3. **Set up the database connection in the server**:
   - Add the database connection string of MongoDB from the MongoDB Atlas.

4. **Install dependencies and run the server and client**:
   - Navigate to the server folder:
     ```bash
     cd rishi-portfolio-server
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Then, navigate to the client folder:
     ```bash
     cd ../rishi-portfolio-client
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```

5. **Add Admin User**:
   - Call the POST endpoint to add admin, with request body having the `email` and the `password`:
